# NASA ADS/Notion referencing extension

This repository contains a first attempt at making a Firefox extension for easily including papers on the [NASA Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) in a [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) database, thus facilitating notetaking in Notion with references backed up by the ADS. 

This project is completely __unaffiliated__ with either NASA or Notion, I'm just a PhD student who is overwhelmed by the number of papers coming out in astrophysics every day and needed a system to try and manage it. I'm not a web developer, so use at your own risk, but hopefully it'll prove helpful to others.
